<h1 style="padding-bottom: 10pt;">Dear President Pines, Provost Rice, and Chief Medical Officer Marinopoulos of the University of Maryland, and Chancellor Perman of the University System of Maryland,</h1>

On January 7, in response to the spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the University System of Maryland announced that [all students living on a USM campus would be mandated to receive a COVID-19 booster shot](https://www.usmd.edu/newsroom/news/2217). Later the same day, [the University of Maryland extended this requirement to include all of its students, faculty, and staff](https://president.umd.edu/articles/spring-2022-covid-precautions-and-requirements).

We are a group of concerned students and members of the UMD and USM communities who write to you to express our grave concerns with these requirements, which we believe to be in contradiction with USM’s values and [the principles of UMD’s reopening framework](https://umd.edu/4Maryland).

## Rationale for the booster requirement

The risk of COVID-19 is real. [Nearly 12,000 Marylanders](https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/) have died of it since the start of the pandemic. [The Omicron variant’s increased transmissibility](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-omicron-so-contagious/) is cause for concern.

The mRNA vaccines are one of the most useful tools that we have to fight the pandemic. The reasoning is that they will 1) reduce the transmissibility of the virus and 2) make serious illness, hospitalization, and death less likely. UMD and USM’s expressed motivations for the booster mandates rests on these two factors. The hope is that mandating boosters will reduce both transmission and serious illness.

However, the reasoning for issuing a blanket booster mandate is flawed. COVID-19 does not manifest the same way in everyone. Both transmissibility and severity [vary widely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7934673/) based on [age](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120307854), [sex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022282821002182), [pre-existing conditions](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/43/7/e72/35546/Obesity-Is-a-Risk-Factor-for-Greater-COVID-19), [differences in access to health care](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4099), [acquired immunity from prior infection](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2773575), [the specific variant](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n3144) [of the virus](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)01005-X/fulltext), and other factors. The [effectiveness of mRNA vaccines](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.05.21264583v1), as well as the [risk of side effects like myocarditis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.23.21268276v1), also vary based on these factors. Therefore, the cost-benefit analysis of the booster is different for every member of our campus and system communities. A blanket mandate, especially one that provides only two weeks to comply, ignores this variation and does not allow students, faculty, and staff a meaningful amount of time to decide whether a booster is the right choice for their health.

## Booster effectiveness at reducing transmission

The vaccines and booster reduce the transmissibility of the coronavirus somewhat. However, this protection is [not as strong as the protection against serious illness](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection), [not sufficient to fully stop transmission in the community](https://www.stardem.com/news/national/cdc-covid-vaccines-won-t-stop-transmission-fully-vaccinated-can-still-get-spread-delta-strain/article_5f83d0cb-8b0a-535d-bbad-3f571754e5ae.html), and widely varying depending on the specific variant of the virus.

[Preliminary data from a study in Denmark](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.27.21268278v1) suggests vastly increased immune evasiveness from successive vaccinations for the Omicron variant compared to the Delta variant. According to the study, non-vaccinated individuals spread Omicron at a rate less than 20% higher than they spread Delta, but fully-vaccinated individuals spread it at a rate over 160% higher, and boosted individuals spread it at a rate nearly 270% higher. The data from Denmark match previous findings [from South Africa](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2943.long), where Omicron was first reported.

In addition, a recent [report from the UK Health Security Agency](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1043807/technical-briefing-33.pdf) reveals that the protection that a booster provides against symptomatic infection (and thus transmission, since people with [symptomatic COVID-19 are the most contagious](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2783099)) is less effective and wanes more quickly for Omicron compared to Delta infections. Specifically, among those who received their first 2 vaccinations from Pfizer, “vaccine effectiveness was around 70% after a Pfizer booster, dropping to 45% after 10-plus weeks.”

These figures demonstrate that the currently available mRNA vaccines, all of which are based on the genetic sequence of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain from Wuhan, have become increasingly ineffective at preventing transmission of a virus that is continuously evolving. And as further mutations develop, COVID-19’s vaccine immunity escape will only grow more complete.

To address the virus’s ability to bypass protections provided by the current vaccines, multiple COVID-19 vaccines specific to Omicron are in development, including [one from Moderna](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/28/moderna-says-an-omicron-variant-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-early-2022.html) and [one from Maryland-based Novavax](https://ir.novavax.com/2021-12-22-Novavax-Announces-Initial-Omicron-Cross-Reactivity-Data-from-COVID-19-Vaccine-Booster-and-Adolescent-Studies). By mandating that people receive boosters now, UMD and USM are denying them the option of receiving these more effective vaccines once they become available in a few months.

Because of these factors, a booster mandate will not achieve UMD and USM’s goals of [containing the spread of the virus and protecting others](https://president.umd.edu/articles/spring-2022-covid-precautions-and-requirements).

## Booster requirement and serious illness

Severe cases of COVID-19, defined as those requiring hospitalization, occur overwhelmingly in non-vaccinated individuals. “Breakthrough” COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated individuals are now common as the virus continues to mutate. A booster can [help mitigate](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.15.21267805v2) the severity of the symptoms that infected and fully vaccinated people experience. However, for people with no pre-existing conditions, these breakthrough cases are [overwhelmingly](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268560v2) [very](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2119270) [mild](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268495v1). Thus, a booster is of limited usefulness for many, as they are still largely protected from serious illness by their initial vaccination. And this limited benefit must be weighed against the risks.

UMD and USM’s role is to ensure the safety of students, faculty, and staff as a whole. Decisions that affect the health of only specific individuals are best left to those individuals, who have a better understanding of their particular circumstances. Given that the vaccines have not been proven to reduce transmission while the initial 2 shots have been proven to still effectively protect vaccinated individuals from serious illness, hospitalization, and death, the necessity of mandating a booster is not clear.

## The risk of vaccine side effects

As scientists receive more data on serious side effects caused by the mRNA vaccines and boosters, UMD and USM must take into consideration the possible side effects of imposing the booster onto young and otherwise healthy adults. According to Dr. Ofer Levy, a voting member on the board of the FDA’s vaccine advisory panel, “as we go into younger and younger age groups, they’re less and less at personal risk of severe COVID, and on the other hand, somewhat [more at risk of this inflammatory heart condition](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/heart-inflammation-risk-in-young-adults-caused-by-mrna-covid-booster-continues-to-worry-scientists-dr-levy-says.html) [myocarditis and pericarditis] with the mRNA vaccine.”

Myocarditis and pericarditis are serious conditions characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle. While the inflammation from myocarditis is temporary, [the body heals the damaged heart muscle with scar tissue](https://www.texasheart.org/heart-health/heart-information-center/topics/myocarditis/). Unlike the muscle that it replaces, the scar tissue does not help the heart pump blood. Because of this, myocarditis can permanently weaken the heart. In severe cases, the damage can be significant and lead to complications long after the original inflammation resolves itself.

According to preliminary results from a recent UK study, in people aged 13 years or more, an [increased risk of developing myocarditis and/or serious heart conditions](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.23.21268276v1) was observed 1-28 days following a third vaccination shot. The risk of developing myocarditis almost doubled after the first Pfizer shot, doubled again after the second, and doubled once more after the third.

The observed risk of developing myocarditis from the vaccines is admittedly low, even after the booster. However, the [risks of hospitalization and death from COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html) for young adults between the ages of 18 and 29 (the majority of people on college campuses) are also very low. Therefore, a cost-benefit analysis must be conducted. And unfortunately, according to the data from the UK study, males under 40 years old are more likely to get myocarditis following a booster shot than they are to get it following infection by COVID-19. [(1)](corrections#note_1)

In fact, findings of increased risk of developing myocarditis and pericarditis are so concerning that Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland have either [banned or are discouraging young adults or teens from getting the Moderna vaccine](https://www.thesuburban.com/news/covid_19/five-scandinavian-countries-limit-or-halt-moderna/article_7ac39fac-fae7-5937-acd1-6f94ac576e39.html).

As part of its reopening plan, UMD has pledged to [“prioritize the health and safety of every member of our campus community.”](https://umd.edu/4Maryland) But as we have seen, by imposing a blanket booster mandate, UMD and USM are threatening the health of community members. UMD and USM have a moral obligation not to force community members to take actions that could put them in unnecessary danger. Instead, they must allow community members the freedom to make decisions about their own health based on a cost-benefit analysis that addresses the individual’s specific needs and risk factors.

## Booster requirements uphold global imbalances in access to vaccination

In the U.S., everyone who could benefit from the mRNA vaccines has had an opportunity to get two doses for many months. We benefit from a strong and well-funded system of medical research as well as a large economy that has allowed us to shoulder the high cost of mass vaccination. Unfortunately, billions of people who live in low-income nations are not so lucky. [In lower-middle-income nations, less than one vaccine dose per person has been administered on average, and in low-income nations, the figure is only slightly over one dose per ten people](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-covid-vaccinations-income-group?country=High+income~Low+income~Lower+middle+income~Upper+middle+income). In addition, many of these low-income nations have high rates of HIV, which makes them even more susceptible to COVID-19.

The World Health Organization has been [sounding the alarm](https://www.who.int/campaigns/vaccine-equity) about this problem for months and has [repeatedly urged](https://www.who.int/campaigns/vaccine-equity/vaccine-commitments-open-letter) the leaders of wealthy nations to help more disadvantaged countries with their vaccination efforts. By allowing the virus to spread unchecked in places like sub-Saharan Africa, the WHO warns us, we are giving it opportunities to mutate. [The mutated variants, which may have developed resistance to the vaccine, will then spread to the entire world](https://www.who.int/news-room/photo-story/photo-story-detail/No-one-is-safe-from-COVID19-until-everyone-is-safe), including the United States and other wealthy nations. Unfortunately, the United States and other high-income countries have generally not listened to the WHO’s pleas, choosing to focus instead on increasingly ineffective booster shots at home.

_[This folly may have led to the emergence of Omicron.](https://www.science.org/content/article/where-did-weird-omicron-come)_ The Omicron variant may have evolved in sub-Saharan Africa, where tragically low vaccination rates and very limited testing allowed SARS-CoV-2 to spread unchecked. And now, Omicron is threatening the United States. If we fall into the trap of pushing increasingly less effective booster doses at home while ignoring tragedy abroad, we will reap nothing but yet more new variants.

In its [reopening framework principles](https://umd.edu/4Maryland), UMD pledged to “make decisions grounded in our values of equity and inclusion.” And USM proclaims itself to be [“dedicated to celebrating, supporting, upholding, protecting, and enhancing diversity and inclusion.”](https://www.usmd.edu/usm/workgroups/diversity/) But with its booster mandate, UMD and USM are giving tacit approval to policies that ignore the suffering of billions and imperil the entire world. Instead of contributing to systemic injustice, UMD and USM should support the World Health Organization in [its quest to ensure that all nations have access to vaccination](https://www.who.int/campaigns/vaccine-equity).

## The course of the Omicron wave is already set in stone

The current surge in coronavirus cases in Maryland [appears alarming at first glance](https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/). But like the March 2020 surge and Delta surges, it is temporary. The new variant is able to infect people who were protected from previous variants, so it spreads exponentially at first. But exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. The pool of new hosts soon exhausts itself, and the case rate then drops back to low levels. In South Africa, the Omicron wave [has already peaked](https://www.gov.za/speeches/cabinet-approves-several-changes-adjusted-alert-level-1-covid-19-regulations-30-dec-2021). Cases have also peaked in [London](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases?areaType=region&areaName=London) and [New York City](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#daily). The rest of the United States should soon follow.

How soon? [The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://www.healthdata.org/) of the University of Washington has developed [state-of-the-art predictive models](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/maryland) of the course of the pandemic. In its [latest projection](https://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/102_briefing_United_States_of_America_3.pdf), IHME expects “reported cases to exceed 1 million a day, peak by the third week of January, and then decline sharply.” In other words, by the time UMD and USM’s booster mandates are set to go into effect, the worst of Omicron should already be behind us.

Researchers, scientists, and medical and public health authorities now accept that SARS-CoV-2 [will become endemic](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/what-will-it-be-like-when-covid-19-becomes-endemic/). This means that we will never fully eliminate the virus. Because new variants emerge regularly and because both immunity and vaccine effectiveness wane over time, it is likely that nearly everyone will be infected at some point, boosted or not. And neither a booster mandate nor any other policy can realistically change this outcome.

The authors of a [Harvard study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/) that found no significant relationship between the percentage of a population that is fully vaccinated and cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people conclude their study by providing perspective from a past pandemic: We must “strike the balance of learning to live with COVID-19 in the same manner we continue to live a 100 years later with various seasonal alterations of the 1918 Influenza virus.” Even though influenza viruses return every year and [kill 290,000 to 650,000 people globally per year](https://www.health.com/condition/flu/how-many-people-die-of-the-flu-every-year), we do not mandate flu vaccines every year. A similar outcome may be in store for SARS-CoV-2.

Fortunately, while infection is inevitable, serious illness is not. We now have [many advanced treatments](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/treatments-for-covid-19) at our disposal for COVID-19, including Pfizer’s Paxlovid, Merck’s molnupiravir, fluvoxamine, monoclonal antibodies, and more. With the help of these new medications and therapies, we can usually treat even the most serious COVID-19 cases successfully. As long as hospitals remain at or below capacity, so that all patients can receive the necessary treatment in time, deaths will be rare. The situation only becomes dangerous if hospitals go over capacity. So as long as we can “flatten the top of the curve,” or ensure that _at its peak_ the Omicron wave does not pressure Maryland hospitals overmuch, we will be in a good position for the rest of the pandemic.

The IHME report presents the prognosis clearly, stating that “alternative policy scenarios, including more rapid scale-up of boosters to all who have been previously vaccinated, increasing mask use to 80%, and vaccinating the partially hesitant, have only a small impact on the trajectory [of the Omicron wave] over the next 4 months. The speed of the epidemic is so fast that policy interventions will have little impact [on transmission].”

In other words, the course of the Omicron wave can no longer be changed by any policy, including a booster mandate. Instead, the IHME report advises “focus[ing] on reducing harm in the vulnerable and minimizing disruption.” UMD and USM have many options for doing this. We present a few possibilities in the next section.

## Alternative measures

Instead of a booster mandate, there are many actions that UMD and USM can take to keep our community healthy.

* [Physical activity helps protect against serious illness from COVID-19.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/does-exercise-help-protect-against-severe-covid-19-202106092475) After 1.5 years of online school, UMD and USM should encourage students and community members to remain physically active by continuing and expanding its many recreation and wellness programs.
* [P100 respirators, which block 99.97% of particles](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/96-101/default.html) (N95s only block 95%) are too uncomfortable and unwieldy for general use. However, they can be useful for community members who are immunocompromised or otherwise at greatly increased risk from COVID-19. P100 respirators should be made available to these populations.
* Also for the benefit of students who are immunocompromised, professors should be encouraged to record lectures, so students do not have to attend physically (this is especially well-suited for high-enrollment courses held in large lecture halls).

## Conclusion

We understand that UMD and USM may hesitate to rescind their respective booster mandates after having communicated them to the campus and system communities. However, in light of the concerns and evidence that we have put forth in this letter, UMD and USM have a duty to reconsider these policies, which beyond failing to achieve their goals of containing the spread of the virus, reducing the risk of serious illness, and protecting others, may lead to irreversible consequences for students, faculty, and staff who are unable to obtain exemptions from the booster mandate.

Instead, UMD and USM should allow community members to make informed personal decisions about the booster based on their unique circumstances. Instead of a booster mandate, UMD and USM should implement alternative measures like the ones we have described in this letter that are targeted to achieve specific objectives given the realities of the pandemic.

We look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

[Students and community members of the University of Maryland and University System of Maryland](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/rescind-useless-umdusm-booster-mandate)
