title: Petition against UMD/USM's misguided booster mandate
description: " "
---

On January 7, the [University of Maryland](https://president.umd.edu/articles/spring-2022-covid-precautions-and-requirements) and [University System of Maryland](https://www.usmd.edu/newsroom/news/2217) announced new mandates requiring university students, faculty, and staff to get a COVID-19 booster shot within two weeks.

We are a group of concerned students and community members who believe these new rules to be misguided, and urge the University and University System to reconsider.
The danger from Omicron is real, and the University does need to take action. But the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that a booster mandate is not the right action.

You can read or sign the full petition (with all the details and sources) by clicking the button below:

Alternatively, here's a summary of the main points:

- The rationale for the booster mandate assumes the effectiveness of the boosters is the same for everybody in all situations. [But that's not true.](petition.html#rationale-for-the-booster-requirement)
- The booster shot reduces the transmissibility of Omicron somewhat, but [not enough to make a difference.](petition.html#booster-effectiveness-at-reducing-transmission)
- A booster requirement [isn't necessary to prevent serious illness from Omicron.](petition.html#booster-requirement-and-serious-illness)
- The boosters come with a risk of side effects like myocarditis.
It's not a very large risk, but for many people the risk from COVID-19 is also small.
[Therefore, for much of the campus community, the risks of the booster might outweigh the benefits.](petition.html#booster-requirement-and-serious-illness)
- Billions of people around the world have not had the opportunity to get even a single dose of vaccine.
Instead of administering unnecessary boosters here in the US, [we should be sending vaccines to those who need them most.](petition.html#booster-requirements-uphold-global-imbalances-in-access-to-vaccination)
- Omicron is moving so fast that by the time the spring semester begins, the wave will already be behind us.
[Mathematical models predict that a booster mandate would have no impact on Omicron's spread at this stage.](petition.html#the-course-of-the-omicron-wave-is-already-set-in-stone)
- Instead of a pointless mandate, [there are many alternative measures UMD and USM could take that would be effective in keeping students, faculty, and staff safe.](petition.html#alternative-measures)
